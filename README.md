Analyze temperature trends over time.
Examine precipitation patterns.
Investigate wind speed variations.
Visualize the findings using plots.

Tools and Libraries:-
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

1.Analyzing Temperature Trends
Analyze how the temperature has changed over time.
2.Examining Precipitation Patterns
Investigate the precipitation patterns over the same period
3.Investigating Wind Speed Variations
Examine how wind speeds vary over time.

Summary and Insights:-
After the analysis, summarize the key findings. Create a report or a presentation with the visualizations and insights derived from the data.
Conclusion:-
This project outlines the process of loading, preprocessing, and analyzing weather data using Python. By following these steps, you can extract meaningful insights from historical weather data, which can be useful for various applications such as climate research, agricultural planning, and more.
